# Deep Learning Systems - Final Project

## Overview
This is a course project for the CMU [10-714 Deep Learning Systems](https://dlsyscourse.org/).

The goal of this project is to support the "NEEDLE" deep learning framework with pretrained weights and architectures, completed with [@guomk](https://github.com/guomk) and [@ElvishElvis](https://github.com/ElvishElvis). Please refer to our [project report](report.ipynb) for detailed description of this project.

The complete project repository depends on homework implementation of NEEDLE framework to compile and run, which should not be made public. Therefore, this repository is directly forked from the public homework repo, which does not contain any homework solution.
